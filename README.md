#### Main Take-away: Updated codebase in order to follow accessibility standards.

### Goals for this project:
    -Update code as needed to improve accessibility
    -Restructure as needed to improve readability

### What I did:
    -Reviewed HTML document to replace any non-semantic code with semantic code
    -Ensured the structure of HTML elements are logical
    -Added alt attributes to all image elements
    -Ensured heading attributes are in sequential order
    -Improved the title element
    -Consolidated CSS code for better readability

### What I learned:
    During the course of this challenge, I gained a better knowledge of how CSS and HTML work together. This relationship is what takes a website from purely informational to asthetically pleasing as well. I was also able to instill best practice habits for accessibility standards in order to make this site user-friendly for assistive devices, as well as optimize search engine output.
